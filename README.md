# LocationTracker
#Location Tracker 🗺️
---
A simple and efficient Python-based location tracking application that utilizes geolocation APIs to fetch details such as latitude, longitude, address, and more. This project is ideal for learning how to work with APIs, handle JSON responses, and create practical tools for location-based services.

#Features ✨
---
- Fetch current location details (latitude, longitude, address).

- Reverse geocoding to get the address from coordinates.

- Displays map links for easy navigation.

- Error handling for invalid inputs or API failures.

- Simple and modular Python code for easy understanding.

#Requirements 🛠️
---
- Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher

- requests library for API communication

- Access to a geolocation API (like OpenCage Geocoder, PositionStack, or Google Maps API)

#Installation 💻
---
Install libraries:
```txt
pip install phonenumbers
```

```txt
pip install folium
```


```txt
pip install opencage
```

Install the required Python packages:

- Get your API key from the chosen geolocation service and add it to the script.

#Usage 🚀
---
Run the script:

- It will create a 'Location.html' file

- From that Fetch the location.
